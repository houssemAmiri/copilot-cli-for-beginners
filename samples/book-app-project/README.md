# Book Collection App

*(This README is intentionally rough so you can improve it with GitHub Copilot CLI)*

A Python app for managing books you have or want to read.
It can add, remove, list, search, and filter books, and mark them as read.

---

## Current Features

* Reads books from a JSON file (our database)
* Searches titles and authors with case-insensitive partial matching
* Filters by read status, author, and publication year
* Input checking is weak in some areas
* Some tests exist but probably not enough

---

## Files

* `book_app.py` - Main CLI entry point
* `books.py` - BookCollection class with data logic
* `utils.py` - Helper functions for UI and input
* `data.json` - Sample book data
* `tests/test_books.py` - Starter pytest tests

---

## Running the App

```bash
python book_app.py list
python book_app.py add
python book_app.py find
python book_app.py remove
python book_app.py mark-read
python book_app.py search
python book_app.py filter
python book_app.py help
```

`search` looks for a word or phrase in a book title or author name.
`filter` prompts for a read status (`all`, `read`, or `unread`) and optional
author and publication year values.

## Running Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

## Notes

* Not production-ready (obviously)
* Some code could be improved
* Could add more commands later
